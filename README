A Safari extension to strip Comic Sans MS from any page on the internet.

This code is released on the following conditions:
 - If you redistribute you must remove all references to "Phillip Hutchings" and sitharus.com from the code, or talk to me nicely.

You are welcome to fork to implement features, I'll consider all pull requests.

Other than that it's so simple you can do whatever.
